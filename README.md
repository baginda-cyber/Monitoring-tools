Monitoring Tools Setup
This repository contains the Docker Compose configuration files for setting up a comprehensive monitoring stack using Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Promtail, cAdvisor, Node Exporter, and Blackbox Exporter. These tools provide robust metrics collection, visualization, log management, and endpoint probing for monitoring your microservices-based applications in a production environment.

Tools Included
   -  Prometheus: Collects and stores time-series data for metrics from various sources.
   -  Grafana: Visualizes metrics and logs with customizable dashboards and alerts.
   -  Loki: A log aggregation system designed for storing and querying logs efficiently.
   -  Promtail: Collects logs from applications and ships them to Loki.
   -  cAdvisor: Monitors container performance and resource usage.
   -  Node Exporter: Collects hardware and OS metrics from Linux systems.
   -  Blackbox Exporter: Probes endpoints like HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, TCP, and ICMP to monitor their availability and response times.
